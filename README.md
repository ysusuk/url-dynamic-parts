## General
1. Naive algorithm is the most convinient and simple to understand but will indeed need at least memory to hold list of parts.
1. Simple algorithm will need extra processing power, since it will do a lot of char by chare traversal (`takeWhile` and `dropWhile`)
1. Next algorithm (no implemented) will more efficient ways to take and drop values.
